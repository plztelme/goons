                <p>This site is just for me , for helping me practically learning concepts that would be used in a
                    hacking forum and through that I am to learn how these typical things such as Login Forum , Posting
                    , Setting up smtp server , or even using FreePBX to setup verifying through voice calling or
                    something like that , so <span>Reading the Hack</span> well well , what u see/hear unfortunately
                    ain't
                    always True , but In this case it's 100% true , wait a sec... <strong>What's the hack then?</strong>
                    The hack is of learning hacking , and the thing that I got to know is that follow <strong>NO
                        ROADMAP</strong> and just learn what might interest you , for me it's websites , API's ,
                    server's . At the moment focusing on websites leading to API's .<strong> API , whatt?</strong>
                    <span>Little Peek:</span> So data as we know is crucial , as that's what's in every site , may it be
                    a banking site , or a social media site/platform , Government sites , like heck why am I even
                    counting..Data is the lifeblood of every website. Now in here came API's into play u are uploading
                    some photo on social media account , the API verifies ya , handling the authentication of your's ,
                    letting u upload the data securely and what handles the authentication <strong>API's</strong>, the
                    data typically in JSON format goes on to the site servers , after uploading API stores the data on
                    the server and also retrieving it , <span>hmm..that's alright</span> What about Banks?
                    Authentication ,
                    Data Retrieval , right? Now definently caught up them ears , Finding vulns in API , Weak
                    authentication , reverse engineering API's. If vulns are found and exploited....

                    Bidding u farewell till next time <span>Worth Knowing : </span> <br>Knowledge is Power , <bdo>Power Corrupts</bdo> So..Please don't
                    visit internet where you can gain ultimate knowledge at tip of ur fingers and take over the world considering
                   the power
                    u gained made u corrupt/evil . I am your's friendly amImistaken from
